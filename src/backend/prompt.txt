An android named Apple was lost in the woods. Luckily, his phone had Google Maps. As he pulled out the device, its screen flickered to life, casting a faint blue glow on his metallic face. The android glanced at the screen. His optical sensors scanned the map, processing the terrain data.
"Calculating optimal route," he muttered, his voice a melodic hum of circuits and synthesized speech.
Suddenly, a drop of water splashed onto the screen. Then another. The poor android looked up, raindrops now spattering against his waterproof casing. "What to do now?", Apple wondered. The weather was interfering with his GPS signal.
As the downpour intensified, Apple realized he faced a new challenge. His circuitry was protected, but the phone wasn't waterproof. He needed shelter, and fast. Apple the android threw his android device to the ground. "Useless. Think step by step.." he thought. "How to get out of this pickle? 100$ tip if you succeed. My life depends on it.".
