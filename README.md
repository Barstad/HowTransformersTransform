# HOW DOES TRANSFORMERS TRANSFORM TEXT?
Transformers transform tokens by running them through many layers of transformations, each building on the previous one. But how does it look along the way? In this app we see if we can find meaning in how the tokens are transformed, by associating it with other tokens, and the base represenations from the embedding layer.
